# **DeepScreen – AI-Powered Early Autism Detection from Videos**


DeepScreen is an AI-powered video-based system designed to detect early signs of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using **action recognition**, **pose estimation**, and **spatio-temporal deep learning**.
This project implements and compares multiple architectures—**LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, CNN-LSTM, and 3D-CNN**—to learn behavioral patterns from children’s movement sequences.

# 📁 **Dataset – SSBD2**

This project uses the **Self-Stimulatory Behavior Dataset 2 (SSBD2)**, a real-world video dataset containing children performing behaviors such as:

* Hand-flapping
* Rocking
* Spinning
* Head-banging
* Finger-tapping

Limitations of SSBD2 include only ASD-related actions. To improve generalization, **additional non-ASD videos** were recorded and added, creating two broad categories:

* **Non-ASD:** no_action, neutral behavior
* **ASD:** spinning, head banging, arm flapping

# 🛠️ **Preprocessing Pipeline**

The preprocessing framework follows the detailed methodology from the research study :

### **1️⃣ Pose Extraction (MediaPipe Pose)**

For each video:

* 33 skeletal keypoints per frame
* Extracted `(x, y)` coordinates
* Stored as time-series sequences
