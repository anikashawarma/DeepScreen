# **DeepScreen – AI-Powered Early Autism Detection from Videos**

*A Comparative Deep Learning Framework for Behavioral Analysis Using SSBD2*

DeepScreen is an AI-powered video-based system designed to detect early signs of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using **action recognition**, **pose estimation**, and **spatio-temporal deep learning**.
This project implements and compares multiple architectures—**LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, CNN-LSTM, and 3D-CNN**—to learn behavioral patterns from children’s movement sequences.

This work is based on the research project **AI-Powered Early Autism Detection from Videos: A Comparative Approach** .

## 🚀 **Key Features**

* ✔️ Behavioral analysis using **skeletal pose sequences**
* ✔️ Video preprocessing with **MediaPipe Pose (33 keypoints)**
* ✔️ Spatio-temporal deep learning pipelines
* ✔️ Comparative evaluation of five model families
* ✔️ ~95.69% accuracy achieved with **Bi-LSTM**
* ✔️ Supports multi-class classification (e.g., *action*, *no_action*, *spinning*, *head banging*, *arm flapping*)
* ✔️ Dataset extension through custom video recordings

# 📁 **Dataset – SSBD2**

This project uses the **Self-Stimulatory Behavior Dataset 2 (SSBD2)**, a real-world video dataset containing children performing behaviors such as:

* Hand-flapping
* Rocking
* Spinning
* Head-banging
* Finger-tapping

Limitations of SSBD2 include only ASD-related actions. To improve generalization, **additional non-ASD videos** were recorded and added, creating two broad categories:

* **Non-ASD:** no_action, neutral behavior
* **ASD:** spinning, head banging, arm flapping

# 🛠️ **Preprocessing Pipeline**

The preprocessing framework follows the detailed methodology from the research study :

### **1️⃣ Pose Extraction (MediaPipe Pose)**

For each video:

* 33 skeletal keypoints per frame
* Extracted `(x, y)` coordinates
* Stored as time-series sequences

| **Bi-LSTM** | **0.9569** | 0.9566    | 0.9569 | 0.9560   |
| GRU         | 0.9051     | 0.9051    | 0.9051 | 0.9035   |
| CNN-LSTM    | 0.9267     | 0.9266    | 0.9267 | 0.9266   |
| 3D-CNN      | 0.8621     | 0.8898    | 0.8621 | 0.8624   |
| LSTM        | 0.8577     | 0.8549    | 0.8577 | 0.8546   |

📌 **Bi-LSTM outperformed all architectures**, proving that bidirectional temporal context is critical for ASD behavior recognition.
